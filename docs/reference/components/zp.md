Introduction
============

This page describes the generation of the zebrafish phenotype ontology

Details
=======

The ZP differs considerably from [HP], [MP] and others. ZFIN do not
annotate with a pre-composed phenotype ontology - all annotations
compose phenotypes on-the-fly using a combination of PATO, ZFA, GO and
other ontologies.

We use these combinations to construct ZP on the fly, by naming each
distinct combination, assigning it an ID, and placing it in the
hierarchy.

The process is described here:

OWL Axiomatization
==================

The OWL axioms for ZP are in 
[zp.owl](https://compbio.charite.de/hudson/job/zp-owl/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/)
that is build on our hudson server.
