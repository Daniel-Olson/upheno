## Goals:

- Summarise the top 5 outcomes of the workshop
- Consolidate 3 workout groups
- Draft a solution with up to 10 upper level categories and the constraints mentioned by the workshop participants:
  - Biological process is too high level to be a useful category, subdivide
  - Molecular function phenotypes are a bit funky
  - There should be a environmental exposure phenotype category
  - anatomical system vs organ problem: think kidney. David things phenotypes for major organs - maybe we need an organ grouping. Think about signal/ration. David: maybe we should try system-only for now and see how it goes. But will we have some organs that drop out? You could try to check for organs that would not fall under any of the system groupings (ubergraph).
- Within each category, select up to 10 sub-categories based on the id_name column or other suggestions made by participants. Keep in mind there is _always_ and other category.
