Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation." []

The adenomas are most often tubular, and they have the tendency to progress to adenocarcinoma. They can occur throughout the colon, but they tend to concentrate in the rectum and sigmoid colon. The colorectal adenomas are detected during endoscopic examination between the age of 10 and 20 years. The adenomas increase in size and numbers with age, and there is usually progression of one or more adenomas to adenocarcinoma. The mean age of development of adenocarcinoma is about 40 years. Signs include rectal bleeding and mucousy diarrhea." []
