# Design Patterns

This folder contains design patterns for groupings of classes in the ontology.

The design patterns are specified in YAML, and follow the [dead_simple_design_patterns](https://github.com/dosumis/dead_simple_owl_design_patterns/) specification

Consult each yaml file for details on the specific pattern.
